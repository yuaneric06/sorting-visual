# Sorting visual
A fun website to visualize many different sorting algorithms in action. There are some meme algorithms too (stalin sort, bogo sort, and miracle sort).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Web Assembly, C++

A C++ backend served as the "engine" which ran all the sorting algorithms. Web assembly was used to convert the C++ to JavaScript, and React + a <canvas> element was used for the frontend. 

## Lessons Learned:

I used web assembly! I think it is a really great tool, something I will probably use a lot in the future. I also learned about many different sorting algorithms, my favorite being quicksort.
